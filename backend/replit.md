# FastAPI Modern Application

## Overview

This is a modern FastAPI application built with a clean, modular architecture following best practices for Python web development. The application provides a RESTful API with comprehensive user management functionality, health monitoring endpoints, and interactive documentation. It uses UV for fast Python package management and implements a service layer pattern for business logic separation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Application Structure
The application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **API Layer**: FastAPI routers handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation with async/await support
- **Model Layer**: Data models using Python dataclasses for entity representation
- **Schema Layer**: Pydantic models for request/response validation and serialization

### Core Components

**FastAPI Application Factory**
- Centralized application configuration in `app/main.py`
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Modular router inclusion system

**Router-Based API Organization**
- Main API router combining all endpoints under `/api/v1`
- Separate routers for different domains (users, health)
- Dependency injection for service layer integration

**Configuration Management**
- Environment-based configuration using Pydantic BaseSettings
- Support for development/production environments
- Centralized settings in `app/core/config.py`

**Health Monitoring**
- Comprehensive health check endpoints for container orchestration
- Separate liveness, readiness, and detailed health endpoints
- Timestamp and service information included in responses

**Data Validation**
- Pydantic schemas for type-safe request/response handling
- Base schema classes with common functionality
- Separate schemas for create, update, and response operations

**Service Layer Pattern**
- Business logic abstraction in service classes
- Async/await support for scalable operations
- In-memory data storage (designed for database integration)

### Design Patterns

**Dependency Injection**
- Service layer dependencies injected into API endpoints
- Promotes testability and loose coupling

**Repository Pattern** (prepared)
- Service layer designed to accommodate database repositories
- Clean separation between business logic and data access

**Schema Validation**
- Strong typing throughout the application
- Pydantic models for automatic validation and documentation

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for building APIs
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the application

### Package Management
- **UV**: Fast Python package manager for dependency management

### Development Tools
- **Type Hints**: Full type safety throughout the codebase
- **Async/Await**: Modern Python async programming support

### Database Integration (Prepared)
- Configuration includes DATABASE_URL for future database integration
- Service layer designed to work with ORM or database repositories
- SQLite default configuration with support for other databases

### External Services (Configurable)
- External API key configuration for third-party integrations
- Logging level configuration for monitoring services
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

The application is designed to be easily extensible with additional services, authentication mechanisms, and database integrations while maintaining clean architecture principles.
